This file consist of schematics and layout of vco
Designed VCO with Current mirror as PMOS and current going through PMOS to centre tap inductor
Used Varactor diode as VTUNE to tune the exact frequency
Completed the layout of the above VCO without any error of LVS and DRC
Designed the whole Schematics and layout in Cadence UMC 65 technology
Achieved Specifications: Max.Kvco > 200Mhz/volt, Phase noise < −100 dBc/Hz, Power < 3000μW
